# Little Journey - Killer Features Progress

## Current Session: 2026-01-16

### Task Selection
Selected: CAPSULE-001 (Create time capsule letter)
Priority: 1 (Architectural decisions and core abstractions)
Reasoning: Time Capsule is completely unimplemented. Requires new context, data model, and sealed/unlock pattern that other CAPSULE features will build upon.

### Implementation Complete

**Task:** CAPSULE-001 core architecture
**PRD Ref:** Time Capsule - CAPSULE-001 through CAPSULE-007

**Key Decisions:**
- Types defined in context file (follows existing pattern)
- CapsuleStatus: sealed | unlocked | opened_early
- UnlockType: age | custom_date
- Preset ages: 5, 10, 18, 21 (per PRD)
- Capsules sealed immediately on creation (CAPSULE-004)
- forceUnlock marks as "opened_early" (CAPSULE-007)

**Files Changed:**
- NEW: contexts/time-capsule-context.tsx (125 lines)
- NEW: __tests__/contexts/time-capsule-context.test.tsx (7 tests)
- NEW: progress-killer-features.txt

**Verification:**
- tsc --noEmit: PASS
- npm run lint: PASS
- npm test (time-capsule): 7/7 PASS
- npx expo export --platform web: PASS

**Notes:**
- Context foundation complete. UI screens needed for full CAPSULE-001 pass.
- Pre-existing flaky test (entry-detail.test.tsx timeout) unrelated to changes.
- API service deferred - follows same pattern as other contexts.
