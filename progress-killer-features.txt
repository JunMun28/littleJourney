# Little Journey - Killer Features Progress

## Current Session: 2026-01-16

### Task Selection
Selected: CAPSULE-001 (Create time capsule letter)
Priority: 1 (Architectural decisions and core abstractions)
Reasoning: Time Capsule is completely unimplemented. Requires new context, data model, and sealed/unlock pattern that other CAPSULE features will build upon.

### Implementation Complete

**Task:** CAPSULE-001 core architecture
**PRD Ref:** Time Capsule - CAPSULE-001 through CAPSULE-007

**Key Decisions:**
- Types defined in context file (follows existing pattern)
- CapsuleStatus: sealed | unlocked | opened_early
- UnlockType: age | custom_date
- Preset ages: 5, 10, 18, 21 (per PRD)
- Capsules sealed immediately on creation (CAPSULE-004)
- forceUnlock marks as "opened_early" (CAPSULE-007)

**Files Changed:**
- NEW: contexts/time-capsule-context.tsx (125 lines)
- NEW: __tests__/contexts/time-capsule-context.test.tsx (7 tests)
- NEW: progress-killer-features.txt

**Verification:**
- tsc --noEmit: PASS
- npm run lint: PASS
- npm test (time-capsule): 7/7 PASS
- npx expo export --platform web: PASS

**Notes:**
- Context foundation complete. UI screens needed for full CAPSULE-001 pass.
- Pre-existing flaky test (entry-detail.test.tsx timeout) unrelated to changes.
- API service deferred - follows same pattern as other contexts.

### Task Selection
Selected: GROWTH-001 (Record height measurement) - context/architecture
Priority: 1 (Architectural decisions and core abstractions)
Reasoning: Growth Tracking has no context. Foundation needed for GROWTH-001 through GROWTH-008. Includes WHO percentile data, measurement types, and calculation logic.

### Implementation Complete

**Task:** GROWTH-001 through GROWTH-008 core architecture
**PRD Ref:** Growth Tracking - GROWTH-001 through GROWTH-008

**Key Decisions:**
- MeasurementType: height | weight | head_circumference
- PercentileStandard: who | singapore (placeholder for SG data)
- WHO percentile data for boys/girls 0-24 months (p3, p15, p50, p85, p97)
- Measurements sorted by date descending (latest first)
- Percentile ranges: below 3rd/above 97th marked as outside normal range
- Singapore standards option added per GROWTH-004 (data TBD from HPB)

**Files Changed:**
- NEW: contexts/growth-tracking-context.tsx (280 lines)
- NEW: __tests__/contexts/growth-tracking-context.test.tsx (13 tests)
- MODIFIED: progress-killer-features.txt

**Verification:**
- tsc --noEmit: PASS
- npm run lint: PASS
- npm test (growth-tracking): 13/13 PASS
- npm test (all): 678/679 PASS (1 pre-existing flaky test)
- npx expo export --platform web: PASS

**Notes:**
- Context foundation complete. UI screens needed for full GROWTH-001 pass.
- WHO reference data simplified to key ages (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 months)
- Singapore HealthHub integration (GROWTH-004, SGLOCAL-004) requires official HPB data
