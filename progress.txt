# Little Journey - Development Progress

## 2026-01-14: Core Tab Navigation Setup

**PRD ref:** Phase 1 Weeks 1-2 Foundation, Section 4.1 Primary View

**Task:** Set up 4-tab navigation structure (Feed, Milestones, Search, Settings)

**Decisions:**
- Used index.tsx as Feed tab (Expo Router convention for default route)
- Removed template explore.tsx
- Icons: house.fill (Feed), star.fill (Milestones), magnifyingglass (Search), gearshape.fill (Settings)
- headerShown: true for proper screen titles

**Files changed:**
- app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx - Updated with 4 tabs
- app/(tabs)/index.tsx - Feed screen (renamed from feed.tsx)
- app/(tabs)/milestones.tsx - New placeholder
- app/(tabs)/search.tsx - New placeholder
- app/(tabs)/settings.tsx - New placeholder
- Deleted: app/(tabs)/explore.tsx

**Verification:** tsc, lint, test, build all pass

**Next:** Authentication flow or onboarding screens per PRD Phase 1 Weeks 3-4
