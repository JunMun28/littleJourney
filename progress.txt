- providers/query-provider.tsx - New: QueryProvider with configured QueryClient
- services/api-client.ts - New: Typed API client with mock/real implementations
- app/_layout.tsx - Added QueryProvider wrapper (outermost provider)
- __tests__/providers/query-provider.test.tsx - New: 4 TDD tests
- __tests__/services/api-client.test.ts - New: 17 TDD tests for all API operations

## 2026-01-15: TanStack Query Hooks for Entries

**PRD ref:** Phase 1 Technical Architecture (TanStack Query for server state)

**Task:** Create TanStack Query hooks to wrap entryApi, first step in migrating from context-based state

**Decisions:**
- Created use-entries.ts with 5 hooks: useEntries, useEntry, useCreateEntry, useUpdateEntry, useDeleteEntry
- entryKeys factory for consistent cache key management (all, lists, list, details, detail)
- useEntries supports GetEntriesParams for pagination
- useEntry has enabled: !!id to skip fetch when ID undefined
- Mutations invalidate relevant queries for automatic cache sync
- useUpdateEntry also sets detail cache directly for instant UI update
- useDeleteEntry removes detail from cache on success
- TDD approach: 7 tests covering all hooks

**Files changed:**
- hooks/use-entries.ts - New: TanStack Query hooks for entry CRUD operations
- __tests__/hooks/use-entries.test.ts - New: 7 TDD tests for all entry hooks

**Verification:** tsc, lint, test (248 passed), build all pass.

**Next:** Create similar hooks for child/family/milestone APIs, or integrate hooks with Feed screen to replace EntryContext usage

## 2026-01-15: TanStack Query Hooks for Child, Family, Milestone APIs

**PRD ref:** Phase 1 Technical Architecture (TanStack Query for server state)

**Task:** Complete TanStack Query hook layer for remaining domain entities

**Decisions:**
- Created use-children.ts with 3 hooks: useChildren, useCreateChild, useUpdateChild
- Created use-family.ts with 3 hooks: useFamilyMembers, useInviteFamilyMember, useRemoveFamilyMember
- Created use-milestones.ts with 4 hooks: useMilestones, useCreateMilestone, useCompleteMilestone, useDeleteMilestone
- Same pattern as use-entries.ts: queryKeys factory, cache invalidation on mutations
- useMilestones doesn't need pagination (milestones per child are limited)
- useUpdateChild handles optional ID field from API (id?: string)
- useCompleteMilestone updates detail cache + invalidates list for instant UI
- TDD approach: 14 tests total (3 child + 3 family + 8 milestone)

**Files changed:**
- hooks/use-children.ts - New: TanStack Query hooks for child CRUD
- hooks/use-family.ts - New: TanStack Query hooks for family invites/removal
- hooks/use-milestones.ts - New: TanStack Query hooks for milestone CRUD
- __tests__/hooks/use-children.test.ts - New: 3 TDD tests
- __tests__/hooks/use-family.test.ts - New: 3 TDD tests
- __tests__/hooks/use-milestones.test.ts - New: 8 TDD tests

**Verification:** tsc, lint, test (262 passed), build all pass.

**Next:** Integrate hooks with screens to replace context usage, or Cloudflare Workers backend setup

## 2026-01-15: Camera Capture for Entry Creation

**PRD ref:** Phase 1 Weeks 5-7, Section 3.2 step 3 (Select from gallery or capture new), Section 3.3 (Secondary: Camera capture)

**Task:** Add camera capture option as secondary source for photo/video entries

**Decisions:**
- Added "source" step between type selection and caption in creation flow
- MediaSource type: "gallery" | "camera" for source selection
- Source step shows two options: Gallery (primary per PRD) and Camera (secondary)
- Uses ImagePicker.launchCameraAsync for camera capture
- Uses ImagePicker.requestCameraPermissionsAsync for camera permission
- Refactored handleTypeSelect to set step to "source" for photo/video (text skips to caption)
- Created separate handlers: handleSourceSelect, handleVideoSource, handlePhotoSource
- Created reusable asset processors: processVideoAsset, processPhotoAssets
- Camera capture also supports EXIF extraction for photos
- TDD approach: 3 tests for camera mock setup

**Files changed:**
- app/(tabs)/index.tsx - Added source selection step, refactored media flow handlers, added sourceOptions styles
- __tests__/app/tabs/feed.test.tsx - Added 3 camera tests, added expo-image-picker mock with camera support

**Verification:** tsc, lint, test (265 passed), build all pass.

**Next:** Cloudflare Workers backend setup, or additional UI polish

## 2026-01-15: TanStack Query useEntriesFlat Hook

**PRD ref:** Phase 1 Technical Architecture (TanStack Query for server state)

**Task:** Add useEntriesFlat hook to enable Feed screen migration from EntryContext

**Decisions:**
- Created useEntriesFlat hook that wraps useEntries with convenience features
- Flattens paginated API response to simple Entry[] array
- Includes getOnThisDayEntries() computed from entries (same logic as EntryContext)
- Returns loading/error/success states + refetch capability
- Maintains same API shape as EntryContext for easy migration
- TDD approach: 3 new tests for flat hook (total 10 use-entries tests)

**Files changed:**
- hooks/use-entries.ts - Added useEntriesFlat hook with entries array + getOnThisDayEntries
- __tests__/hooks/use-entries.test.ts - Added 3 TDD tests for useEntriesFlat

**Verification:** tsc, lint, test (268 passed), build all pass.

**Next:** Integrate useEntriesFlat + useCreateEntry with Feed screen to replace EntryContext usage

## 2026-01-15: Feed Screen TanStack Query Migration

**PRD ref:** Phase 1 Technical Architecture (TanStack Query for server state)

**Task:** Migrate Feed screen from EntryContext to TanStack Query hooks

**Decisions:**
- Replaced useEntries (context) with useEntriesFlat + useCreateEntry (TanStack Query hooks)
- useEntriesFlat provides: entries array, getOnThisDayEntries(), refetch, isFetching
- useCreateEntry.mutate() replaces addEntry() with onSuccess callback for side effects
- Removed local refreshing state - now uses isFetching from TanStack Query
- Pull-to-refresh now calls refetch() which invalidates and refetches from API
- Storage tracking, notification frequency reset, draft clear moved to onSuccess callback
- EntryContext still exists for type exports (Entry, EntryType, NewEntry)

**Files changed:**
- app/(tabs)/index.tsx - Replaced context with TanStack Query hooks, updated handlers
- __tests__/app/tabs/feed.test.tsx - Added 3 TDD integration tests for TanStack Query

**Verification:** tsc, lint, test (271 passed), build all pass.

- useMilestonesFlat provides: milestones, upcomingMilestones, completedMilestones, refetch, loading states
- Replaced useMilestones (context) with useMilestonesFlat + useCreateMilestone + useCompleteMilestone + useDeleteMilestone
- Mutation handlers use onSuccess callbacks for notification scheduling/cancellation (PRD 7.1)
- Updated test wrapper from MilestoneProvider to QueryClientProvider
- Tests use milestoneApi.createMilestone() directly instead of WithMilestone helper component
- MilestoneContext still exists for type exports (Milestone, MilestoneTemplate, MILESTONE_TEMPLATES)
