# Little Journey - Development Progress

## 2026-01-14: Core Tab Navigation Setup

**PRD ref:** Phase 1 Weeks 1-2 Foundation, Section 4.1 Primary View

**Task:** Set up 4-tab navigation structure (Feed, Milestones, Search, Settings)

**Decisions:**
- Used index.tsx as Feed tab (Expo Router convention for default route)
- Removed template explore.tsx
- Icons: house.fill (Feed), star.fill (Milestones), magnifyingglass (Search), gearshape.fill (Settings)
- headerShown: true for proper screen titles

**Files changed:**
- app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx - Updated with 4 tabs
- app/(tabs)/index.tsx - Feed screen (renamed from feed.tsx)
- app/(tabs)/milestones.tsx - New placeholder
- app/(tabs)/search.tsx - New placeholder
- app/(tabs)/settings.tsx - New placeholder
- Deleted: app/(tabs)/explore.tsx

**Verification:** tsc, lint, test, build all pass

**Next:** Authentication flow or onboarding screens per PRD Phase 1 Weeks 3-4

## 2026-01-15: Auth Context and Route Protection

**PRD ref:** Phase 1 Weeks 3-4, Section 1 (Auth & Onboarding)

**Task:** Set up auth architecture - context, hooks, route protection, sign-in screen

**Decisions:**
- Created AuthProvider + useAuth hook with mock signIn/signOut (ready for backend integration)
- Used Slot-based routing with useSegments for auth gating (Expo Router pattern)
- Auth screens in (auth) route group, tabs in (tabs) group
- Sign-in screen is placeholder with demo flow - will add magic link/OAuth later
- Primary button color hardcoded (#0a7ea4) to work in light/dark mode

**Files changed:**
- contexts/auth-context.tsx - New: AuthProvider, useAuth hook, User type
- app/_layout.tsx - Wrap with AuthProvider, add RootLayoutNav for auth routing
- app/(auth)/_layout.tsx - New: Auth route group layout
- app/(auth)/sign-in.tsx - New: Sign-in placeholder screen
- __tests__/contexts/auth-context.test.tsx - New: TDD tests for auth context

**Verification:** tsc, lint, test (9 passed), build all pass. UI verified via Chrome MCP.

**Next:** Guided onboarding flow (PRD Section 1.3) or child profile creation
